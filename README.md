# Connecting using ssh

after you find the password of the ssh service you will have to connect to the machine with:

*ssh jan@<viaIP_Address>*

and then ssh will ask you about the blueprint you will type (yes).
after typing yes, the ssh service will ask you for the machines password which you have found using
the tool hydra. and scooby doo! you've entered the machine.
